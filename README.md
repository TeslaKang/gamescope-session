# gamescope-session

For reference, Steam OS-related files were implemented in the stock Steam OS, holoiso, and chimeraOS, so I modified them accordingly to make them operate as similar to the original Steam OS as possible.<br>
So things like TDP settings and GPU clock settings that do not work in holoiso and chimeraOS work.<br>
Of course, you cannot set more than the value limited by Steam OS.<br>

Regarding chimeraOS...<br>
