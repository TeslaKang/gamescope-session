For reference, Steam OS-related files were implemented in the stock Steam OS, holoiso, and chimeraOS, so I modified them accordingly to make them operate as similar to the original Steam OS as possible.
So things like TDP settings and GPU clock settings that do not work in holoiso and chimeraOS work.
Of course, you cannot set more than the value limited by Steam OS.

Regarding chimeraOS...
